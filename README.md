# **ENSO Recharge Oscillator Practical: Simulations and Forecasting**  

This repository hosts the **Recharge Oscillator (RO) Practical** for the [ENSO Winter School 2025](https://sites.google.com/hawaii.edu/enso-winter-school-2025/). The practical covers theoretical and computational aspects of the RO framework, its applications in ENSO simulations, and forecasting.

## **Overview**
The RO practial lecture, we will demonstrate how to use the `XRO` framework for **Recharge-Oscillator (RO) model** fitting, simulations, and reforecasting.

***Extended Nonlinear Recharge Oscillator (XRO) framework***

The `XRO` framework was developed to investigate the role of climate mode interactions in ENSO dynamics and predictability ([Zhao et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07534-6)). When other climate modes are not considered, it simplifies to the Recharge Oscillator (RO), making it well-suited for use in this practical context. We have designed `XRO` to be user-friendly, aiming to be a valuable tool not only for research but also for operational forecasting and as an educational resource in the classroom.

***Community Recharge Oscillator (CRO) model framework***

The `CRO` code package is an easy-to-use Python/MATLAB software for solving and fitting the ENSO RO model. The `CRO` code is currently under development and is planned for release in 2025. The distributed version for the ENSO Winter School 2025 is a light Python version that includes only the essential features. While we introduce the `CRO` framework in this practical, some of its functionalities are unavailable. Therefore, for consistency, we will primarily use the `XRO` framework.

For those interested in the `CRO` code, please refer to the Jupyter notebook:  
📂 *CRO_test/RO_Practical_with_CRO_Framework.ipynb*

Special thanks to **Bastien Pagli** for providing the original `CRO` code in Python.
